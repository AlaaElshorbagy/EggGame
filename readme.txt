The classical Egg Game reads as follow:

"A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.
If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.
Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible."


My program is a bit advanced, given the number of floors (may not be 100), it tells you the least possible number of drops and the method you should follow to get the highest floor. 

The answer is 10 for the case of 100 floor
